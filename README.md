# Person Counter using YoloV7

With the help of this code we can find the maximum number of people in a video. In order to optimize the code I skipped the frames instead of taking account of each and every frame!I used Yolov7_384x640. It can be downloaded from https://github.com/PINTO0309/PINTO_model_zoo/tree/main/307_YOLOv7 . The input video has been taken from https://viratdata.org/ . And instead of video being the output,the frames the program has choosen is the output. Also a maximum of all people in all frames is stored in the text file.
